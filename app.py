    # 2. Create a new list that will hold all the html for your blog posts
    blog_html_content = []
    # this is an empty list. save it for later

    # 3. Open the csv file and read it using the CSV library. This will give you a list of rows.
    # See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader


    with open('data.csv') as csvfile:
    # essentially the same as csvfile = open('data.csv') and closes after indent.
    #   we've created a variable, opened it, and we will close it after the indent
        blog_posts = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
        # This is saying, create a variable (a container) and name it
        #       "blog_posts" and fill it with the list from my csv file

    # So now, post_html contains a string of all contents of post.html file, and
    #      blog_posts contains (a list of?) all of the contents in csv file.

    #   post.html is the framework for the individual blog post and data.csv contains the specific
    #       info to populate into the posts

    #   so posts_html needs to be populated with blog_posts

    # 4. Loop over each row in the CSV. Each row is a blog post.

            print(post['category'], post['title'], post['body'], post['author'], post['date'], post['image'])

            post_html = post_html.replace("{{date}}", post['date' ])
            post_html = post_html.replace("{{image}}", post['image'])

    # 6. Add the post_html to the new list you created above.

            blog_html_content.append(post_html)
            # all the contents of post.html that were read and stored in post_html are now list items
            # in the list blog_html_content

    # 7. Join all the items in your new list together into a single string. Name this string "blog_post_html".

        blog_post_html = "".join(blog_html_content)


    # 8. Open the index.html file and replace {{blog_posts}} with the blog post string you just created.
